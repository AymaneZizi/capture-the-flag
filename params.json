{"name":"Capture The Flag","tagline":"A security wargame with 6 challenges, built into a Linux Live CD","body":"Capture The Flag!\r\n=================\r\nBreak through the 6 increasing difficult challenges to capture The Flag!\r\n\r\n\r\nUsing the Live CD\r\n-----------------\r\nThe easiest way to use is with a virtualization software like VirtualBox.\r\nDownload the ISO image, create a virtual machine, and GO:\r\n\r\n0. Download the latest image from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/ctfomatic/files/\r\n1. Create a new virtual machine: Linux, 2.6 kernel\r\n2. Memory: 256MB\r\n3. Hard disk: no need for a disk\r\n4. CD: configure the virtual machine to use the ISO image\r\n   of the Live CD as a CD drive\r\n5. Start the Virtual Machine\r\n\r\nAt the boot prompt, you may want to enter `fr`, `jp` or `hu`\r\nto use French, Japanese or Hungarian keymap, respectively.\r\n\r\nAll the regular boot options of TinyCore should work as well.\r\n\r\nAfter the system has started, you will be presented the\r\ninstructions to pass the first challenge.\r\n\r\nTo install additional software in the running system,\r\nswitch to the `tc` user with the `su - tc` command, and\r\nuse the `tce` program -- TinyCore's package manager.\r\nIt is not complicated, just follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------\r\n![Start](https://github.com/janosgyerik/capture-the-flag/raw/master/images/start.png)\r\n![End](https://github.com/janosgyerik/capture-the-flag/raw/master/images/end.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSolutions\r\n---------\r\nThe solutions are intentionally omitted from this project.\r\nYou may find the solutions to the original Stripe challenges,\r\nbut don't be surprised if they don't work on this Live CD\r\nout of the box. That is intentional too ;-)\r\n\r\nPlease keep your own solutions private.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbusing the CD\r\n--------------\r\nIf you want to get root access in the live system, you can\r\neither do `su - tc` to become the admin user, or boot the\r\nsystem with the `mc superuser` standard TinyCore boot option.\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe challenges are based on the original online contest\r\norganized by Stripe:\r\nhttps://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n* https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag\r\n* https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag-20\r\n* http://io.smashthestack.org:84/\r\n* http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=testall&f=Graffiti&t=CTF\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
