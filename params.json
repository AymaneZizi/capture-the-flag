In order to do that you need\r\nto install 32-bit development libraries. In Debian for\r\nexample the package is called `libc6-dev-i386`.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuilding the Live CD\r\n--------------------\r\nYou have different options to build the CD:\r\n\r\n* Basic build: using a single script to build everything\r\n* 3-step build: 3 steps to give you a chance to customize\r\n* Expert build: if you want to understand everything\r\n\r\nChoose whichever method is most suitable for you.\r\n\r\n\r\nBasic build (for the impatient)\r\n-------------------------------\r\nTo fetch all the necessary files including the 8MB TinyCore base\r\nbase image, the hacking contest data and all the required TinyCore\r\npackages and remaster the CD:\r\n\r\n    ./scripts/rebuild.sh\r\n\r\nNote: some of the steps need to run `sudo`, so you will be prompted\r\nfor your password one or more times.\r\n\r\n\r\n3-step build\r\n------------\r\nThe idea of this build method is to create the basic CD data but stop\r\nbefore rebuilding the image so that you can customize it first.\r\n\r\n1. Build the basic CD data:\r\n\r\n        ./scripts/build.sh\r\n\r\n   Note: some of the steps need to run `sudo`, so you will be\r\n   prompted for your password one or more times.\r\n\r\n2. Customize the contents in the `extract` directory. This step is\r\n   completely up to you, depending on what you want to customize.\r\n   You might want to install some custom packages, for example\r\n   keymaps for non US keyboards:\r\n\r\n        sudo ./scripts/install-tcz.sh kmaps\r\n\r\n3. Create the final ISO:\r\n\r\n        sudo ./scripts/pack-iso.sh\r\n\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\nThe challenges are based on the original online contest\r\norganized by Stripe:\r\nhttps://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to use the CD\r\n-----------------\r\nThe easiest way to use is with a software like VirtualBox,\r\nfor example by following these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Create a new virtual machine: Linux, 2.6 kernel\r\n2. Memory: 256MB\r\n3. Hard disk: no need for a disk\r\n4. CD: configure the virtual machine to use the ISO image\r\n   of the Live CD as a CD drive\r\n5. Start the Virtual Machine\r\n\r\nAt the boot prompt, you may want to enter `fr`, `jp` or `hu`\r\nto use French, Japanese or Hungarian keymap, respectively.\r\n\r\nAll the regular boot options of TinyCore should work as well.\r\n\r\nAfter the system has started, you will be presented the\r\ninstructions to pass the first challenge.\r\n\r\nTo install additional software in the running system,\r\nswitch to the `tc` user with the `su - tc` command, and\r\nuse the `tce` program -- TinyCore's package manager.\r\nIt is not complicated, just follow the instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-----------\r\n![Start](https://github.com/janosgyerik/capture-the-flag/raw/master/images/start.png)\r\n![End](https://github.com/janosgyerik/capture-the-flag/raw/master/images/end.png)\r\n\r\n\r\nSolutions\r\n---------\r\nThe solutions are intentionally omitted from this project.\r\nYou may find the solutions to the original Stripe challenges,\r\nbut don't be surprised if they don't work on this Live CD\r\nout of the box. That is intentional too ;-)\r\n\r\nPlease keep your own solutions private.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbusing the CD\r\n--------------\r\nIf you want to get root access in the live system, you can\r\neither do `su - tc` to become the admin user, or boot the\r\nsystem with the `mc superuser` standard TinyCore boot option.\r\n\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n-----\r\n* https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag\r\n* https://stripe.com/blog/capture-the-flag-20\r\n* http://io.smashthestack.org:84/\r\n* http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=testall&f=Graffiti&t=CTF\r\n\r\n\r\nTodo\r\n----\r\n* Re-implement /levels/level02/level02.py without flask (save 3MB)\r\n\r\n* Implement the second Capture The Flag contest of Stripe\r\n\r\n* maybe: Generalize the scripts to use with other than TinyCore\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
