Congratulations on making it to level 1!
 
The password for the next level is in /home/level02/.password. This
one is a web-based vulnerability, so go ahead and point your browser
to http://localhost:8002/level02.php. You'll need to provide the password
for level02 using HTTP digest authentication.
 
You can find the source code for level02.php in /levels/level02/.
Who knows, you may find it useful.
 
There are a total of 6 levels in this CTF; if you're stuck, feel free
