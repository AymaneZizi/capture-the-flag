Welcome to the CTF challenge!
 
CTF is a wargame, inspired by SmashTheStack I/O[1].
 
In /home/level01/.password is the SSH password for the level01
user. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to read that
file. You may find the files in /levels/level01 useful.
 
There are a total of 6 levels in this CTF; if you're stuck, feel free
to email us for guidance.
 
Happy hacking,
 
The CTF team
