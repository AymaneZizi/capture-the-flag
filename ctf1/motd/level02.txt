Congratulations on making it to level 2!

The password for the next level is in /home/level03/.password. As
before, you may find the files in /levels/level03 useful.
While the supplied binary mostly just does mundane tasks, we trust
you'll find a way of making it do something much more interesting.

There are a total of 6 levels in this CTF; if you're stuck, feel free
to email us for guidance.

Best of luck!
